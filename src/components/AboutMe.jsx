            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I am a skilled web developer with a strong focus on creating responsive, user-centered websites that deliver seamless experiences across all devices. Proficient in front-end and back-end development, I leverage a robust technical toolkit, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, SQL, and React, to build dynamic and engaging digital solutions.
                With expertise in modern design tools like Figma, I ensure every project achieves a balance between aesthetics and functionality. My approach combines technical excellence with a deep understanding of user needs, resulting in websites that are not only visually appealing but also highly intuitive and performance-driven.</p>
